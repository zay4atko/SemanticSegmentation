# Semantic Segmentation of Swiss aerial images

This project provides a uniform description of building usage in Switzerland, such that local governments and companies may make use of it for effective decision making in planning and investment.
Taking as starting point correctly labeled buildings to train Deep Learning models, we can potentially predict building usage for the whole of Switzerland.
